It sounds like you want a description (or explanation) of mobile sales performance discrepancies in Power BI — essentially how to analyze 
and present the gap between actual and target mobile sales using dashboards. Let me give you a structured breakdown:


When describing mobile sales performance discrepancies, you want to highlight where actual sales differ from targets and explain why. 
A good Power BI report should include:

1. Key Metrics
Actual Sales (units/revenue)

Target Sales (forecasted numbers)

Variance/Discrepancy = Actual – Target

% Achievement = (Actual ÷ Target) × 100

2. Visualizations
KPI Cards: Show overall actual vs. target sales, with variance.

Bar/Column Charts: Compare actual vs. target by product, region, or channel.

Variance Chart: Highlight positive (above target) vs. negative (below target) discrepancies.

Heatmap/Table: Show discrepancies across regions or product categories.

3. DAX Measures for Discrepan
